# snake-and-ladder-game
I developed an engaging Snake and Ladder game using JavaFX, and incorporated essential Data Structures and
Algorithms (DSA) skills, particularly a 1D array, to efficiently manage the game logic.

The Snake and Ladder game offers an interactive and visually appealing user interface through JavaFX. Players can roll dice
and advance through the board, facing exciting challenges posed by snakes and enjoying the rewards of ladders.

To implement the game's core logic, I utilized a 1D array datastructure, which efficiently represented the positions of the
snakes, ladders, and players on the game board.
